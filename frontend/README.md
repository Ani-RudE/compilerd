# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, navigate to Frontend Folder:

```cmd
cd frontend
```

Then run:
```
npm install
```

```cmd
npm start
```

Make sure you run the Docker container first and then run the Frontend.
Docker container will occupy the PORT 3000, hence while running the React script, it will ask permission to run on another port. Press `Y` when it asks.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
